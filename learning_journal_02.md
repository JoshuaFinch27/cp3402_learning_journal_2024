# Learning Journal for Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I watched the suggested LinkedIn Learning course: WordPress 5 Essential Training. I also watched various
YouTube videos that helped me get started with the Joomla CMS. I also picked out a free bootstrap template/theme for my
Joomla website.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 7 hours learning about this week's topic.

## Content Insights

Correctly deciding whether a piece of content is supposed to be in a post or a page is important for readability. Rule 
of thumb is that if it's something that you can find on social media then it is a post. Otherwise, it is a page. Additionally,
making sure to use the drafting processes inbuilt into the CMS' is important for keeping a tidy workflow, especially when
working in a group.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I found that I wasted a lot of time searching when I had a 'small' problem that I thought/knew the answer was in the video courses.
Moreover, keeping 10+ tabs open at the same time as a way to mitigate this problem was also wasting time. Therefor, I will
be trialing a solution where I write short notes in a GitHub repository on important topics in the relevant LinkedIn
Learning courses. This way I should only have 1 extra tab open.
