# Learning Journal for Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I mainly studied the LinkedIn Learning course and re-watched videos from a previous uni subject on
CSS and HTML coding as a refresher before attempting the practical.

- CP1406 lecture videos

## Estimated Hours

I spent about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time I spent on the practical.

## Content Insights

I refreshed on the division of purpose for html, css and javascript (function/content, form/style, interactivity)
and on how html and css files are written/put together. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I found that I had trouble when attempting to do the practical before I had fully watched the LinkedIn Learning courses.
Unfortunately, as of time of writing I am still unsure about some parts of the html. In particular how to insert images
into <svg> tags. I will have to look into this further in the coming week.
