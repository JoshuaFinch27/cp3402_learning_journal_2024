## Estimated Hours

5 -> 4 spent watching LinkedIn Learning Courses


## Content Insights

Insights from LinkedIn Learning Courses:
- Mapping The Modern Web Design Process: Get Perspective (what are you doing, who are you doing it for); Preprocess (roles
and responsibilities, baseline documentation, version control); Content Strategy (user personas, content modelling, wireframes);
Prebuild Testing (Test with paper cards and wireframe); Build Track; Test and Revision; Optimisation; Launch and Reset.

- Version Control for Everyone: Can use Git/version control for more than just code. Can use it for images, big projects
in Word and other apps like Photoshop and Sketch. Relevant to the second assignment is that it can also be used for building
a WordPress theme.

- Migrating WordPress: Set up the target site; migrate plugin and theme, and upload files using FTP; migrate database
using WP Migrate DB. Remember to match table prefixes. There is a Pro version but it costs ~$400. Can move media files 
using a plugin. Has enough 'known problems' to have that be its own entire section in the LinkedIn Learning Course...

  
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Version control is considered even more important/widespread than I initially thought. I will have to spend more time 
researching Git and similar pieces of software. I will also need to look into visual version control software since I have 
trouble understanding the command line.
