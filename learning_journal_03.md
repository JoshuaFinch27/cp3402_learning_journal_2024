## Content Insights

Understanding how to navigate a CMS is usually the hardest part of working with one. At least for the more popular ones,
every bug and error that you get is usually your own fault for not setting things up correctly. One major stumbling block
that I eventually overcome was how to correctly insert images into the website. That being to use the larger horizontal
button to insert images that are already uploaded to WordPress instead of the regular 'image' icon button that is 
instead used for linking images that are hosted on other websites. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

When I ran into issues using WordPress that the lecture videos and LinkedIn Learning courses were not able to solve I 
found a surprising (to me) solution, ChatGPT. Asking it about the issues usually either ended up with it giving me a list 
of steps to take to resolve the issue, or it directly listed places for me to look for specific answers. While by no means
a perfect solution to all of my troubles. It certainly made troubleshooting a much less stressful task.
